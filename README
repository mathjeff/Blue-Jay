PURPOSE:
The Blue-Jay project is to create a recommendation engine to better predict which song a user would like to listen to in his or her media player with minimal user input.
It will make use of more time-sensitive data than other recommendation engines typically use.
This will allow the engine to make educated guesses based on which songs go together, which mood the user may currently be in, and similar factors.

TECHNOLOGY:
We have created a plugin for the open-source media player Songbird

INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:
You must have the music player Songbird, which is a free and open source download available at http://getsongbird.com/
To install Blue-Jay:
1. Open Songbird.
2. Go to Tools->Addons and click "Install"
3. Navigate to the file "InstallableBlueJay.xpi" on your computer
4. When Songbird prompts you to restart Songbird, restart Songbird

USAGE INSTRUCTIONS:
1. After starting Songbird, click the pane button at the top-right corner of the screen to view the Blue-Jay user interface.
2. Push Songbird's play button to start the player.
3. Click "ok" on each of the windows. Once the song changes, the engine has started successfully

RATING INSTRUCTIONS:
To rate a song, use the bar on the right-hand side of the screen, to the right of the words "Rate Song." This gives the rating to Blue-Jay.
Each rating you assign to a song has a timestamp associated with it. Just because you like a song now doesn't mean you will like it later, and vice versa.
Each time you select a number of stars from the dropdown menu, it assigns that rating to the current song. It does not show any popup confirmation window because that would get annoying after a while.
The current number of stars being displayed on the dropdown menu means very little: it only shows the most recent rating that you gave to any song (not necessarily the current song).

Blue-Jay also keeps track of when you skip a song and will override the newly chosen song with a song chosen by Blue-Jay.

Enjoy!
